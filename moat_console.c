/* This code implements the DS2423 counter (obsolete and no-longer-produced).
 * Only the features necessary for reading the physical counters are
 * implemented; the rest is of no particular interest. Yet.
 */

/* Input pins are PA0 thru PA7, depending on the definition of NCOUNTERS.
   If ANALOG is defined, these pins are read by the ADC and an adaptive
   hysteresis is used to trigger the counters, otherwise they are used
   as straight digital inputs. */

/* if SLOW is defined, a decaying average (factor 2^-SLOW) is used to
   lowpass-filter the (analog) result. Use this if you want to monitor e.g.
   a blinking LED, while not being distracted by ambient neon lighting.
   Note that sample frequency is approx. 8 kHz / NCOUNTERS.
