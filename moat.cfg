doc: 'This is a sample configuration file. It''s written in YAML because that''s structured
  and easy to read.

  The "cfg" program can extract single entries from this. It will concatenate list
  entries and convert hashes to C flags definitions.

  ''_ref'' means that whatever key is not here is looked up there, so the value of
  test.1.foo is ''bar''. ''_default'' does the same thing, except that the key is
  skipped, so the value of test.1.foo.seven is ''six''.

  ''targets:'' lists the devices that are built by default.'
