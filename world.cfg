doc: 'This is a sample configuration file. It''s written in YAML because that''s structured
  and easy to read.

  The "cfg" program can extract single entries from this. It will concatenate list
  entries and convert hashes to C flags definitions.

  ''_ref'' means that whatever key is not here is looked up there, so the value of
  test.1.foo is ''bar''. ''_default'' does the same thing, except that the key is
  skipped, so the value of test.1.foo.seven is ''six''.

  ''targets:'' lists the devices that are built by default.

  "cfg <file> .cdefs DEVICE" generates -DXXX=yy command-line arguments.

  "cfg <file> .cfiles DEVICE" lists the input files required for building.

  "cfg <file> .type DEVICE" generates "foo N" stanzas for gen_eeprom''s "type" entry.

  "cfg <file> .hdr DEVICE" generates the file ''device/DEVICE/dev_config.h''.

  The "cfg_write" program updates or adds values. It does not follow ''_ref'' links
  and ''_default'' entries, so only specific values will be overwritten.'

        pwm: outputs that are PWM controlled, i.e. poor man's DAC
        smoke: interfaces with Gira Dual detector
        count: transition counter
      port:
      - Port to read/write by default. Like "B2" or "D0". Indexed by port number
      - '''^'' : A: 1: output high'
      - '''_'' : B: 0: output low'
      - '''+'' : C: 1: pull-up resistor'
      - '''~'' : D: 0: high-impedance'
      - 'Standard behavior: switch between states A/B and C/D when writing 0/1.'
      - Add / to switch A/D and B/C instead.
      - Add ! to switch A/C and B/D instead. (In that case, CD is 'high'.)
      - Add * to alert on state change. Setting a port sets the expected state to
        whatever you write.
      pwm:
      - Number of the port to manage
      - Add * to alert if the PWM stops (zero value, i.e. one-shot)
      - Add ! to immediately switch if PWM is set
      count:
      - Number of the port to count transitions on
      - Add * to alert on counter change.
      adc:
      - 0…7: Analog input pin to read
      - G: read ground pin (to measure ADC offset)
      - R: read bandgap voltage (Do not use "R-", that obviously makes no sense)
      - T: read temperature sensor (Do use "T-" instead of "T")
      - -: use bandgap voltage (Vbg) as reference (~1.1V)
